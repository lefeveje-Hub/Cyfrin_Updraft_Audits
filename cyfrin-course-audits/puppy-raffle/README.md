# Puppy Raffle Audit

## Overview

This repository contains my audit work for the **PuppyRaffle** smart contract as part of the [Cyfrin Updraft Smart Contract Auditing Course](https://updraft.cyfrin.io/). This is a beginner-level practice audit designed to teach foundational security concepts in Solidity.

**Original Course Repository:** [Cyfrin/foundry-fund-me-cu](https://github.com/Cyfrin/4-puppy-raffle-audit)

## About the Protocol

PuppyRaffle is a raffle protocol where users can:
- Enter raffles by paying an entrance fee
- Win cute puppy NFTs with varying rarities (common, rare, legendary)
- Protocol takes a 20% fee, winner gets 80% of the prize pool

## Audit Results

### Findings Summary
| Severity | Count |
|----------|-------|
| High     | 4     |
| Medium   | 4     |
| Low      | 0     |
| Info     | 8     |
| **Total** | **16** |

### Key Vulnerabilities Identified
- **Reentrancy Attack** - Drain contract via refund function
- **Weak Randomness** - Predictable winner selection
- **Integer Overflow** - Fee calculation issues
- **DoS Attacks** - Gas limit and malicious winner scenarios
- **Unsafe Type Casting** - uint256 to uint64 truncation

## Key Learnings

### Technical Skills
- üîç **Vulnerability Pattern Recognition** - Identifying common attack vectors
- üß™ **Proof of Concept Development** - Writing tests to demonstrate exploits
- üìä **Gas Analysis** - Understanding DoS through expensive operations
- üõ°Ô∏è **CEI Pattern** - Checks-Effects-Interactions for reentrancy prevention

### Audit Process
- **Manual Code Review** - Line-by-line analysis for logic flaws
- **Foundry Testing** - Using vm cheatcodes for exploit simulation
- **Impact Assessment** - Evaluating severity and business impact
- **Mitigation Strategies** - Proposing practical fixes

### Tools Used
- **Foundry** - Testing framework and local blockchain
- **Solidity** - Smart contract analysis
- **Slither** - Static analysis (referenced)
