# PasswordStore Audit

## Overview

This repository contains my audit work for the **PasswordStore** smart contract as part of the [Cyfrin Updraft Smart Contract Auditing Course](https://updraft.cyfrin.io/). This is my first practice audit designed to teach foundational security concepts and the audit process.

**Original Course Repository:** [Cyfrin/2023-10-PasswordStore](https://github.com/Cyfrin/3-passwordstore-audit)

## About the Protocol

PasswordStore is a simple protocol designed for a single user to store and retrieve their password. The contract is intended to:
- Allow only the owner to set passwords
- Allow only the owner to retrieve passwords
- Keep the password private and secure

## Audit Results

### Findings Summary
| Severity | Count |
|----------|-------|
| High     | 2     |
| Medium   | 0     |
| Low      | 1     |
| Info     | 1     |
| **Total** | **4** |

### Key Vulnerabilities Identified
- **[H-1] On-chain Storage Visibility** - All blockchain data is publicly readable
- **[H-2] Missing Access Controls** - Anyone can call `setPassword` function
- **[L-1] Initialization Timeframe** - Password starts empty until first set
- **[I-1] Incorrect NatSpec** - Documentation doesn't match function signature

## Key Learnings

### Fundamental Security Concepts
- üîç **Blockchain Transparency** - Understanding that private variables aren't actually private
- üõ°Ô∏è **Access Control** - Importance of proper function modifiers and owner checks
- üìö **Documentation** - Ensuring NatSpec matches actual function signatures
- üîß **Foundry Tools** - Using `cast` to read storage slots directly

### Audit Process
- **Manual Code Review** - Line-by-line analysis for basic security flaws
- **Storage Analysis** - Understanding how data is stored on-chain
- **Test Development** - Writing proof of concept tests for vulnerabilities
- **Impact Assessment** - Evaluating severity of findings

### Tools Used
- **Foundry** - Testing framework and blockchain interaction
- **Cast** - Reading storage slots directly from blockchain
- **Anvil** - Local blockchain for testing

## Files

- `test/PasswordStore.t.sol` - Test suite with vulnerability proofs
- Audit report (PDF) - Complete findings and recommendations

## Course Progress

This audit represents my first step in the Cyfrin Updraft Smart Contract Auditing course. It covers fundamental concepts that are essential before tackling more complex protocols.

**Next Steps:** Moving on to more advanced auditing techniques and complex DeFi protocols.
